# Building device configurations from Jinja2 templates

This sounds not so complicated but initially you must understand several Ansible terms and actions.
1. Inventory
2. Roles
3. Templates
4. Tasks
5. Vars
6. Playbooks

## Ansible inventory

## Ansible roles
Use *ansible-galaxy init asr9k* for creating folder structure and files for a new role. Use *--offline* option if you don't have connectivity to Internet. Otherwise you'll get en error:
```
ERROR! The API server (https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/) is not responding, please try again later.
```

## Jinja2 templates

## Ansible tasks

## Ansible vars

## Ansible playbooks
