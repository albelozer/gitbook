# Ansible

Ansible is a tool that can automate a lot. You can do all of this with custom scripts but with Ansible you get a readable and clear scripts with tasks which work with built in or third party modules. This is called *playbook* in Ansible.

Currently I'm using this tool to build Cisco IOS ans IOS XR configuration from Jinja2 templates. Next I want to learn several [network modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html) which allow to configure Cisco devices running IOS, IOS XR, NX OS.
